# D2WeaponsDiscordBot
A Discord bot that returns weapon information and possible perk combinations from Destiny 2. Checks the Bungie API daily and compares the manifest files against the files locally stored. Updates the local files whenever updates are made to Bungie's manifest. User can use a `/weapon` or `/weapontext` command which will generate an image or Discord embed containing details about the weapon.
